-- The result format is in the following example.


-- solution
select name from SalesPerson where sales_id not in (select sales_id from orders 
where com_id = (select com_id from Company where name = 'RED'));

-- other solution
select s.name
from SalesPerson s
where s.name not in
    (select s.name
    from SalesPerson s
        left join Orders o on s.sales_id = o.sales_id
        left join Company c on o.com_id = c.com_id
    where c.name = 'Red')

-- another way
SELECT s.name FROM SalesPerson s 
	WHERE s.sales_id NOT IN (
		SELECT o.sales_id FROM Orders o LEFT JOIN Company c 
			ON c.com_id=o.com_id 
		WHERE c.name="RED"
	);
